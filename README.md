Dynamic favicon

This is a project that looks at how to make a favicon that changes with CSS prefers-color-scheme.
This uses a SVG and CSS to change the colours when the user changes their prefers-color-scheme.

Requirements are HTML, CSS and a little JS [I know it would be a lot better if we did not need JS]
